This opened my eyes to how much the world has to offer and how big the gap is between my hometown community and first-world societies. These contrasting experiences have shaped my worldview on how education can be the means to liberate lives. Without access to quality education, this economic and quality-of-life gap will keep widening. Realizing how many people worldwide were in my shoes yet not fortunate enough to access quality education opportunites, I turned sympathy into actions.\"",
