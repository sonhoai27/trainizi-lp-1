It was right in front of me: my family, my neighbors and strangers I met on the streets. Education then came and gave me opportunities to work and travel around the globe. This opened my eyes to how much the world has to offer and how big the gap is between my hometown community and first-world societies. These contrasting experiences have shaped my worldview on how education can be the means to liberate lives. Without access to quality education, this economic and quality-of-life gap will keep widening. Realizing how many people worldwide were in my shoes yet not fortunate enough to access quality education opportunites, I turned sympathy into actions.\"",
