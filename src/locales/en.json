      "content2": "To ensure maximum efficiency, the system was standardized and impersonalized with curriculums, textbooks, lectures, and grading. Our early industrial capitalists benefited from this one-size-fit-all methodology which helped them acquire abundant workers to scale horizontally. Fast forward to today, the “industrial era” is long behind us but “factory learning” is still alive.",
